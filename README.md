# NGC7469_2nu
Supplementary material related to the paper "Two 100 TeV neutrinos coincident with the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469"
This project is aimed to reproduce the results and the plots of the paper.

The project contains 5 folders:
- `src`, it contains all the programs necessary to reproduce the results and plots of the paper, in particular:
  - `statistical_test.py`, it reproduces the statistical tests producing the bacground distributions of the test statistic (ts) and calculating the ts value for the neutrino doublet IC220424A & IC230416A with NGC 7469. It saves the results in `data_results`;
  - `areas_ratio.py`, it reproduce Figure 1, about the ratio between the contour area of Millipede and SplineMPE;
  - `coincidence_plots.py`, it reprocuces Figure 2 and 3, about the reconstructed directions of IC220424A and IC230416A by the GCN Notices and GCN Circulars and the position of NGC 7469;
  - `ts_dependence_on_flux.py`, it reproduces Figure 4, about the dependence of the test statistic on the intrinsic neutrino flux (a parameter of the Goodness-of-Fit test);
  - `plot_test_statistics.py`, to plot the background test statistic distributions generated by `statistical_test.py`, one of this plot is Figure 5 in the paper;
  - `produce_sed.py`, to reproduce Figure 6, about the SEDs of NGC 7469 and NGC 1068 and the measured neutrino flux. It also estimates upper and lower limits for the neutrino flux of NGC 7469.
- `data`, it contains the various data needed by the programs in `src`, in particular:
  - `IC_Alerts_Table_Energies.csv`, all the data about the GCN Circulars for the neutrino alerts from 2019 until October 2023;
